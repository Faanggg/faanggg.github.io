					<h2>What are battleships</h2>
					<img class = "left" src = "images/Richelieu.jpg">
					<p>Battleships were the capital ships of the world's navies from about 1860, when it began to supplant the wooden-hulled, sail driven <dfn title = "A type of sailing warship that formed the backbone of the Western world's great navies from the mid-17th century through the mid-19th century, when it gave way to the steam-powered battleship.">ship of the line</dfn>, to World War II, when its position was taken over by <dfn title = "A naval vessel from which airplanes may take off and land on.">aircraft carriers</dfn>. They combined large size, powerful guns, heavy armor and underwater protection with fairly high speed, great cruising radius and general sea-worthiness. At their peak, they were able to hit targets with great precision at ranges of over 30km and were able to absorb heavy damage while remaining afloat and continuing to fight. In World War II, battleships mainly served to bombard enemy coastal defenses in preparation for amphibious assault and as part of the air-defense for carrier task forces.</p>

					<h2>Where are they now</h2>
					<img class = "right" src = "images/USS_Missouri.jpg">
					<p>After World War II, it became apparent that battleships were no longer worth the considerable cost of construction and maintenance. As the role of aircraft engagements grew, ranges grew longer and longer, making heavy gun armament irrelevant. The armor of battleships were equally irrelevant in the face of nuclear missles, with ranges of 100km or more, that could be mounted on smaller vessel classes such as destroyers. By the end of the 1950s, these ships, which formerly offered no noteworthy opposition to battleships, were now capable of eliminating battleships from outside the range of the ship's heavy guns. The last battleship, USS Missouri, was decommissioned in 1991.</p>

						<p>A ship of the line was a large unarmored wooden sailing ship which mounted a battery of up to 120 <dfn title = "A smoothbore weapon is one that has a barrel without rifling.">smoothbore guns</dfn> and <dfn title = "A carronade is a smoothbore, cast-iron cannon which was used by the Royal Navy.">carronades</dfn>, which came to prominence with the adoption of the line of battle tactics in the early 17th century.

					<h2>Steam power</h2>
					<img src = "images/NapoleonBattleship.jpg">
					<div class = "slide-up" id = "timeperiod2">
						<p>Over time, ships of the line gradually became larger and carried more guns, but otherwise remained quite similar. The first major change to the ship of the line concept was the introduction of steam power as an auxiliary propulsion system, introduced in the first half of the 19th century. Initially for small craft and later frigates, the French Navy introduced steam to the line of battle with the 90-gun Napol√©on in 1850, the first true steam battleship. The introduction of steam accelrated the growth in size of battleships.</p>

					<h2>Ironclads</h2>
					<div class = "slide-up" id = "timeperiod3">
						<p>The adoption of steam power was only one of the technological advances that revolutionized warship design in the 19th century. Guns that fired explosive or incendiary shells were a major threat to wooden ships, and these weapons quickly became widespread after the introduction of 8-inch shell guns as part of standard armament of French and American line of battle ships in 1841. The development of high-explosive shells made the use of iron armor plate on warships neccessary and with it,  the ship of the line was overtaken by the ironclad.</p>

						<p>In 1859, France launched the Gloire, the first occean-going ironclad warship. Although made of wood and reliant on sails for most journeys, Gloire was fitted with a propeller and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armor. This prompted further innovation from the Royal Navy, anxious to prevent France from gaining a technological lead.</p>

Within two years, Italy, Austria, Spain and Russia had all ordered ironclad warships and  by the time of the clash of USS Monitor and CSS Virginia at the Battle of Hampton Roads, at least 8 navies possessed ironcald ships.</p>

					<h2>Pre-dreadnought battleships</h2>
					<img src = "images/USS_Texas.jpg">
					<div class = "slide-up" id = "timeperiod6">
						<p>The term "battleship" was officially adopted by the Royal Navy in the re-classification of 1892. By the 1890s, there was an increasing similarity between battleship designs and the type later became known as the "pre-dreadnought battleship" emerged. These were heavily armored ships, mounting a mixed battery of guns in turrets and were without sails. The typical first-class battleship of the pre-dreadnought era displaced 15,000 to 17,000 tonnes, had a speed of 16 knots and an armament of four 12-inch (305mm) guns in two turrets and aft with a mixed-caliber secondary battery amidships around the superstructure.</p>

					<h2>Dreadnought era</h2>
					<img src = "images/HMS_Dreadnought.jpg">
					<div class = "slide-up" id = "timeperiod7">
						<p>In 1906, the British Royal Navy launched the revolutionary HMS Dreadnought. Created as a result of pressure from Admiral Sir John ("Jackie") Fisher, HMS Dreadnought rendered existing battleships obsolete. Combining an "all-big-gun" armament of ten 12-inch (305mm) guns with unprecedented speed, from steam turbine enginges, and protection, she prompted navies worldwide to re-evaluate their battleship building programs. While the Japanese has laid down an all-big-gun battleship, Satsuma, in 1904 and the concept of an all-big-gun ship had been in circulation for several years, it had yet to be validated in combat. Dreadnought sparked a new arms race, principally between Britain and Germany but reflected worldwide, as the class of warships became a crucial element of national power.</p>

					<div class = "slide-up" id = "timeperiod8">
						<p>Following World War I, many major naval powers were crippled after the war. Faced with the prospect of a naval arms race against the United Kingdom and Japan, which would in turn have led to a possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to concludee the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan.</p>

					<h2>Post World War I</h2>
					<img src = "images/WashingtonNavalConference.jpg">
					<div class = "slide-up" id = "timeperiod9">
						<p>The Washington Naval Treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the First Geneva Naval Conference (1927), the First London Naval Treaty (1930), the Second Geneva Naval Conference (1932), and finally the Second London Naval Treaty (1936), which all set limits on major warships. The treaty limitations meant fewer battleships were launched in 1919 - 1939 than in 1905 - 1914. The treaties also inhibited the development by imposing upper limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British N3-class battleship, the first American South Dakato class and the Japanese Kii class, all of which continued the trend of larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor, never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as treaty <dfn title = "A battleship built in the 1920s or 1930s under the terms of one of a number of international treaties governing warship construction.">battleships</dfn>. These treaties became effectively obsolete on September 1, 1939, at the beginning of World War II.</p>
